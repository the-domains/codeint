# Signposts of Change

Traditianl warefare has always had three main types of campaigns, 

Military 

Economic 

Propaganda 

Warefare does not always mean that all three types of capains are in use. On the contrary, the structure of policy making both in the United States and in forien counties typical seperates the three elements into their own policy making wings, making it difficult for a united campain.
We typical see propoganda caimpans being confronted by other propoganda campains. Economic actions are typicaly countered by economic actions. This is largley due to the fact that economic anayists and policy makers work in one room, while propoganda anilists and policy makers work in anohter. The one exception to this is military campains which tend to lvelage either one or both other campains. Typicly because military campains are led by officals that overlook all thee types of campains.
In a world of limited warfare, where the United States has taken a reactionary apprach to many world events how do you leverage all three aspects of traditinal warfare without overstepping another countries risk tolerance? 
Analists typicly create a signposts list of observable events that one would expect to see if a postulated situation is developing.

Analists are seperated by region, but building signposts within your region may not always take into account the internatinal reprocutions
