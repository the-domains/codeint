As results of the Brexit referendum were released on June 23rd, effects of the decision instantly began to manifest themselves.

**Economic Effects **

Economic effects were seen as the pound plunged into a 31-year low. Investors trying to shelter their financial assets flocking to Asian markets, gold, and other historically safe investments. When the U.S. stock markets closed June 24th, the DOW was down over 600 points. The impact of the Brexit on global financial architecture still remains to be seen. What is know is it will have a substantial global impact that will take time to repair. 

**Political effects**

Political effects were seen almost immediately as well, with Prime Minister David Cameron announcing that he would be stepping down. Resentment between French and German leaders and their British counterparts -- a group that, with the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, will undoubtedly be made up of the very leaders who led the charge for Brexit -- could spill over into NATO's own internal deliberations. NATO leaders will need to do everything they can to prevent Brexit from casting a pall over the critical NATO Summit that begins two weeks from today in Warsaw.

**Impacts on Global Security Architecture**

The West's Global Security Architecture has also taken a heavy setback from the Brexit. Since the 1990s, the E.U. has worked to establish a military and defense competence that would allow it to take autonomous action outside of NATO. Without the U.K., the E.U.'s military and defense capabilities -- including in key areas such as strategic lift, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, and special forces -- are considerably reduced. Unless traditionally cautious Germany dramatically reorients its security and defense policy, the French will be the only country remaining in the E.U. with both the necessary military power and political will to use that power outside of NATO.

The Brexit has also signaled to other far right parties in the E.U. such as the National Front and the National Democratic Party of Germany that referendums to leave the EU are a viable option. Regardless of how or even if Briton still choses to leave the EU, other far right political parties have gained momentum because of the Brexit vote. Additionally the Brexit vote signals to Russia that the EU is unstable, leaving E.U. counties that are not part of NATO, such as Finland, waiting to become a way for Russia to test E.U. risk tolerance.

As migration, Russia, and terrorism continue to grow, U.S. leaders must continue to work closely with E.U. and NATO members on intelligence, nuclear issues, special forces and critical overseas counterterrorism operations, providing unity and leadership in the defense arena through times of difference.
