Russia's most recent involvement with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) in Turkey could be seen as further retaliation for the November 2015 shooting down of Russian aircraft, but it is also consistent with a larger trend within Russian Foreign policy to asses NATO risk tolerance.

In 2014 the "little green men" in Ukraine began a trend in Russia's Foreign policy. By arming and training local militia forces Russia could achieve a few strategic goals with minimal risk.

- Protecting from a large scale NATO build up at its boarder.

- Defending the Russian narrative and building on Russian exceptionalism.

- Determining U.S. and NATO risk tolerance.

By sending Russian troops to train, assist, and support propaganda and military operations in eastern Ukraine, Russia was able to gauge NATO and U.S. risk tolerance for non NATO countries. If Russia's presence in Ukraine crossed U.S. and NATO risk tolerance, troops would be withdrawn and their presence in Ukraine could be denied.

Russia's supporting of the PKK allows NATO and U.S. risk tolerance to be measured in a NATO country. If the risk tolerance is crossed, Russia can deny arming and assisting the PKK, or can argue that like the United States fighting alongside the YPG, Russian troops have aided the PKK in their fight against ISIL. 

If the United States and NATO react against the PKK attacks in Turkey to strongly, or invoke Article 5 they risk alienating Kurdish fighters and YPG allies. If the United States and NATO temporarily ignore PKK attacks on Turkey, they signal to Russia a risk tolerance that is willing to tolerate breaches of NATO countries. 

With enough backing it is not impossible that the PKK could declare an autonomous area within Turkey. Forcing NATO to respond or signaling to the world that U.S. risk tolerance will allow ethnic autonomous regions within NATO. 

NATO's reaction to the PKK will not only impact the war against ISIS, but signal to other NATO counties what response will be given if an 'ethnic uprising' occurs within their country. Outside the region it will signal other state actors like China how the United States would respond to 'ethnic' problems in the south China sea.

The United States and NATO's response to the PKK in Turkey will shape how US foreign policy is interpreted around the world.
