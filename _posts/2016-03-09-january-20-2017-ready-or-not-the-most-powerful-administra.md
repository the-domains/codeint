# Cyber Policy Through Transition

January 20, 2017, ready or not, the most powerful administration on earth will begin a peaceful transition of power. The keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. will be transferred from one President to the next. Looking though the volumes of history, this will be the first time   

For the first time in history, a cyber policy will be handed over from one administration to another. It is not a perfect policy, and it certainly is not a comprehensive policy; but it is the first time the United States of America has attempted to think about and create a useable cyber policy, both as it relates to economic actions, but more importantly to how it related to acts of war. It will also be the first time an incoming president has a cyber policy already operating. 

During World War l, the definition of war changed. Long gone were the limited battles that knights fought against one other for honor. Long gone were the chivalrous handing over of a General's sword to accept defeat. War was the complete mobilization of every aspect of military and civilian life. This "complete war" was only sustainable for a limited time, and at the end of World War ll, every human on earth understood that if ever there were a World War lll, that life as we know it would never be the same again. We had reached the point where a "complete war" would result in mutual annihilation. 

The Cold War emerged as a testament to this fact. The theaters of war largely stopped existing in tangible form, and instead morphed in the War of Ideas. The War of Ideas did not take place on a physical battlefield but rather emerged as a grey, non-tangible battle for the human mind. This is not to say that men where not still shooting at each other --- they were, but entire nations were not mobilized as they were in both World Wars. The tangible aspects of the Cold War were a direct result of the War of Ideas. 

The cyber battlefield has emerged as another non-tangible battlefield. Like the War of Ideas that came before it, it can manifest itself in physical forms. Cyber warfare may present itself as an attack on a power or water plant, an oil pipeline, a nuclear reactor, or a military base. These are "one-time use" cyber-attacks, they are difficult to execute, and almost impossible to duplicate, because executing them the first time exposes the vulnerability that allows the problem to be fixed. 

The real cyber battlefield emerging is the battlefield of machine learning and AI. An age where one machine, looking over giant datasets can accurately predict a country's risk tolerance, and response possibilities in real time. The same way Amazon and Google can predict what you want to buy, before you even know the item exists --- machines looking at information across an entire region of the world will be able to predict what a foreign country is willing to withstand. This is a battlefield where security and encryption are no longer about protecting citizen's data from a government, but rather protecting a machines risk tolerance analysis from a foreign government machine's risk tolerance analysis. This is the first time in history where most of mankind will sit back and watch machines fight a battle of ideas for us. This is the first time in human history that SIGINT and HUMINT will be merged into a single form of intelligence. CODEINT. 

It is with this background that on January 20, 2017, a cyber policy will transfer into the hands of an incoming president. It will take months, if not years for all Schedule C employees to be nominated though Congress. This gives plenty of time for the current Cyber policy to be tested and evolve without the direction of a Schedule C appointee. This blog seeks to explore CODEINT, both as it relates to the United States upcoming election --- but also as it unfolds in the theater of cyber war.
