Traditional warfare has always had three main types of campaigns,

**Military**

**Economic**

**Propaganda**

Warfare does not always mean that all three types of campaigns are in use. On the contrary, the structure of policy making both in the United States and in foreign counties typically separate the three elements into their own policy making wings, making it difficult for a united campaign.

We typically see propaganda campaigns being confronted by other propaganda campaigns. Economic actions are typically countered by economic actions. This is largely due to the fact that economic analysts and policy makers work in one room, while propaganda analysts and policy makers work in another. The one exception to this is military campaigns which tend to leverage either one or both other campaigns. Generally, because military campaigns are led by officials that overlook all three types of campaigns.

In a world of limited warfare, how do you leverage all three aspects of traditional warfare without overstepping another country's risk tolerance?

Analysts create 'signpost' lists of observable events that one would expect to see if a postulated situation is developing. These signposts take into account the security architecture of a country or region, but what about the global security architecture? Analysts are separated by region, but building signposts of change within the analyst's respective region may not always take into account international repercussions. For example, how is the US reaction to military activity in Ukraine perceived by China? Are policy makers dealing with 'little green men' thinking about how their actions may be perceived by the 'little blue men' in the south China sea?

At what level do analysts and policy makers at PACOM take into account how their actions are perceived by regional actors located in AFRICOM? And what level of certainty can we ascribe PACOM's assessment of regional actors outside of its region?

We should acknowledge there is certainly collaborative work between regions, but is this collaboration enough to support a global security architecture? With budgets not able to sustain a large enough work force to analyze a dataset of ever changing global information, are policy makers doomed to forever be making reactionary policies to global events?

I would suggest that the answer to these questions is artificial intelligence. A giant global recurrent neural network capable of sorting information into signposts and analysis of competing hypothesis but also capable of performing key assumption checks and other analytical tools. The role of this architecture would not be to replace the analyst, but rather to supplement the menu of policy options offered to leaders. The framework for this architecture already exists, the AI itself may or may not currently exist. To understand the policy architecture behind a global AI we need to explore three areas that typically have very little overlap within the IC. The medical field, the policy making field, and the information technology sector.

With a global AI, limited warfare could be waged in the economic, propaganda and military theaters with each type of warfare complementing its counterpart operating just below another country's risk tolerance.

Please note, this post will be updated as the policy, medical, and cyber fields are explored in detail. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89152bf4-5efc-4cb5-a9a1-3ba9837a1b70.jpg)
